# Multithreading

### Process and threading basics

* Process is a collection of resources. It is represented by a Process Control Block (PCB).
* On every context switch, process-specific state is stored in the PCB, which is in memory itself.
* What makes process context switching expensive is:
    * Registers have to be stored.
    * Virtual memory mappings have to be stored. Restoring these is very expensive.
    * CPU Cache is flushed so the new process can populate it. Repopulating it on every context switch requires fetching instructions from memory anew (very expensive).
* PCB has (among other things) following pieces of information:
    * Process number
    * Program Counter
    * Registers' state
    * Memory limits (i.e. virtual memory mappings)
    * Open files (handles)
    * Priority
    * CPU scheduling info
* Thread is a unit of executing and scheduling.
* Threads share address space.

### Concurrency control and coordination

* Synchronization mechanisms are:
    * Mutual exclusion (*mutex*) marks critical sections. Critical sections are pieces of code that, while the thread is in them, cannot get preempted by the OS. Make sure you are in critical sections __as briefly as possible__.
    * Condition variable - a specific condition which has to be fulfilled before proceeding. While the thread is in a You then make your thread wait on the condition variable (thread block here). Other threads then send a signal/broadcast on that same condition variable once some state changes. This puts your thread back into the ready state so it can get scheduled again by the CPU. Make sure you check the condition variable again before proceeding (use the *while* loop), because some other thread might have acquired the variable and changed its value before your thread got a chance to get scheduled.

### Thread Representation and Thread Creation

* As a general representation of a thread, a thread variable of a thread type contains the data as in the figure below:

* Threads are created by Thread 0 doing a *fork()*, thus creating a Thread 1.
* Thread 0 can decide whether he is interested in the result of Thread 1 by calling *join()* on Thread 1. This will block Thread 0 until Thread 1 finished. If Thread 0 doesn't require Thread 1 result, then both can continue to run concurrently.
